As per Oscar Wilde, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

The names "Prometheus" and "Thanos" have recently been taken up by a ransomware group. There's not much we can do about that except to inform you that this is happening. There's not much you can do either, except be aware of it in case it pops up.

As there's a non-zero chance that the ransomware group chose the names deliberately and thus might come across this blog post: Please stop. With both the ransomware and the naming choice.
